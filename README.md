## Design 
With the user in mind, I wanted to create a website that travellers can easily search, add and amend different activities and tips about travelling to India. I used a simplisitic style with cards that show pictures of the place visited, and also drop down menu where the user can add into the specific category. 

## Colour Scheme  

I chose this colour scheme for simplicity of Website.

![Roming-In-India Colour Scheme](media/README.img/colorkit%20(2).png)

## Images  

As this website is based on India, I have included images of the country in order to show the diverse aesthetic of India.  

The front page has a background hero image crated by Midjourny.

## Icons  

I used the social media on the footer Icons, which are located on the footer from, Font Awesome.  

## Structure  
I have used simple structure and navigation link for user friendly.
 

## Navigation Bar  

Navbar
Each page features a responsive Materialize navbar thatâ€™s collapsed to a burger icon when viewing on smaller screens. The navbar has a hover effect so when the user hovers over the different pages the text changes color. In the left corner there is a logo with a link that takes you to the landing page.

 1. Users that are not logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
 * HOME
 * SHOW PLACES
 * ADD PLACES
 * SIGN UP
 * LOG IN

 2. Users that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
 * HOME
 * SHOW PLACES
 * ADD PLACES
 * ACCOUNT
 * LOG OUT

 3. Admin that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
 * HOME
 * SHOW PLACES
 * ADD PLACES
 * ACCOUNT
 * MANAGE CATEGORIES
 * LOG OUT

## Social Media Links (Footer) 

This includes the icons which take the user to the relevant social media page  

I have added social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin ,Twitter and Gov. Indian Website. 

## Places In India Page
The Places page features a search bar at the top and below are links to the different categories that the Places and Tips and Advice are divided into so you can filter out the category you're intrested in. The Places and Information are presented in a grid with image cards.

### Search bar
Allows the user to search for the name of a Places and Informations about India places. This will then filter out all the Places and Categories that includes the word that was searched.
### Cards
 the front the user is provided with an image of the Places in india Or Information Image followed by the category and then the name. There is also an hover effect when you move the cursor over the cards to highligt and click on the card the Image is displayed it will take you for description page. If you're the user who has uploaded the Places you also have the possibility to edit or delete it.
### Account
On top of the Account page there is a button to Add Places and below is all the Places and Information uploaded by the user.

### Add Places
As a registered user you can upload ythe most visited places in india and tarvel tips. To do this you fill in a form that includes:

Category List
Place Name
Location
Description
Image
All fields need to be filled out for the form to be submitted.

* Edit Places You can edit your own Place or travel tips. The form is prefilled with the information that you have filled out so it's easy to adjust any changes.

* Delete Places You can delete your own Place or Information. When you click on the delete button a confirmation modal pops up to assure you want to delete the Place and not doing it accidentally.

### Sign Up
The Sign up page features a simple form where the user can pick a username and a password. A request is made to MongoDB to check if the username is already in use. If it's not being used a profile is created and the user is directed to their account page.

### Log In
The log in page also features a simple form where the user type their username and password to log in to their account. If the user doesn't exist or make a typo when writing, a flash message appears that says "Incorrect Username and/or Password".

### Manage Categories
When site admin is logged in there is a page to manage the categories List. It's possible to either edit or delete the existing categories or to add new ones by admin only.
## Current Features  

I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop, by using the Media query and meta view port. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices.
