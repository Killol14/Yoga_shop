## Design 
With the user in mind, I wanted to create a website that user can buy Yoga and Meditation Products, user can search add, update, remove product Quantity , Size, and colour if available. user Can securlly Place the order and get the Notification as a real Online Yoga Product Store.
## Colour Scheme  

I chose this colour scheme for simplicity of Website and more like a Yoga Product. Calmness on Layout of the store.

![Roming-In-India Colour Scheme](media/README.img/colorkit%20(2).png)

## Images  

All Images are free Downloaded and its only the perpose for E-commerce store.

## Icons  

I used the social media on the footer Icons, which are located on the footer from, Font Awesome.  

## Structure  
I have used simple structure and navigation link for user friendly. I have used Bottstrap4 for this.
Register page, Checkout Page I have used Crispy Template From Django.
 

## Navigation Bar  

Navbar
Each page features a responsive Materialize navbar thatâ€™s collapsed to a burger icon when viewing on smaller screens. The navbar has a hover effect search bar, also above navbar there is baner. right hand side there are two click in for register , login and logout also cart for product total price.

 1. Users that are not logged in have the following pages in the navbar:

 * SHOP ALL
 * YOGA
 * COMPRESSION
 * MEDITATION
 * SPECIAL OFFERS
  AND ON My Account
* REGISTER
* LOGIN

 2. Users that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:
  
 * SHOP ALL
 * YOGA
 * COMPRESSION
 * MEDITATION
 * SPECIAL OFFERS
  AND ON My Account
* LOGOUT
* MY PROFILE 


 3. Admin that are logged in have the following pages in the navbar:

## Social Media Links (Footer) 

This includes the icons which take the user to the relevant social media page  

I have added social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin ,Twitter 


### Search bar
Allows the user to search for the Yoga & Meditation Products also user can search with any letter they like if product available with that name it will appear otherwise message will disply with No Products available.
### Product Card Layout 
Product Description page from Bootstrap4 and Crispyform from Django.
 


### Sign Up
The Sign up page features a simple form where the user can pick a username and a password. A request is made to Django to check if the username is already in use. If it's not being used a profile is created and the user is directed to their account page.

### Log In
The log in page also features a simple form where the user type their username and password to log in to their account. If the user doesn't exist or make a typo when writing, a toasts message appears that says "Incorrect Username and/or Password".

### Manage Poducts
When site admin is logged in there is a page to manage the Product with price and description. It's possible to either edit or delete the existing Product or to add new ones by admin only.
### Manage Categories
When site admin is logged in there is a page to manage the categories List. It's possible to either edit or delete the existing categories or to add new ones by admin only.
## Current Features  

I have created a website that is fully responsive on all screen sizes eg Tablet Mobile Laptop, by using the Media query and meta view port. This allows the texts and images to translate properly on these devices.  
## Database (Django and Elephant)
